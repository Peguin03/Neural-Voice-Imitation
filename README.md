# Neural Voice Imitation

This repository is inspired from CorentinJ's [Real-Time Voice Cloning](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning). This project is built using Django, it is designed to encrypt the audio recording, clone it and give out the imitated voice for almost any text.

## Setup
